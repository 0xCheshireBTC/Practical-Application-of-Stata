## Abstract:

As the essence of talent resources, executives' daily business operations and major decisions directly influence a company's core competitiveness and survival environment. Based on existing theories, this article proposes research hypotheses on the relationship between executive incentives and corporate performance. The study sample selects financial data from A-share listed companies in China from 2015 to 2021. Through constructing regression models, the empirical analysis examines the impact of executive incentives on corporate performance. According to the research results, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Executive compensation incentives are significantly positively correlated with corporate performance; (2) Executive stock incentives are significantly positively related to corporate performance; (3) Regardless of whether it is compensation incentives or stock incentives, the positive impact of executive incentives on corporate performance is more significant for non-state-owned enterprises than for state-owned enterprises. This article provides a theoretical reference for companies to implement executive incentive systems.

## Introduction

With the stage of China's economic transformation and development, talent is essential for enterprises to maintain their competitiveness in a fierce market. As the core talent reserve of the enterprise, senior executives' management and decision-making often impact the company's performance. However, the agency cost problem brought by senior executives is also something that companies cannot ignore. Therefore, it is crucial for companies to attract and retain talents, solve agency problems, and improve company performance. How to inspire their creativity, improve company performance, and enhance competitiveness while maintaining their motivation becomes a vital issue for companies. Consequently, how companies operate their development strategies and establish incentive policies for senior executives while ensuring stable growth of company performance has become the focus of current research. The executive incentive system can solve the aforementioned problems, and a well-designed incentive mechanism can align the goals of senior executives with the company, improve their efficiency, and stimulate their abilities, striving to improve the company's operational performance. Therefore, it is still meaningful to study the improvement of company performance through the implementation of executive incentive policies, achieving a win-win situation for principals and agents.

## Theoretical Analysis and Research Hypotheses

### 1. The impact of executive compensation incentives on company performance

To solve the agency problems that arise from daily business operations, it is essential to design and implement effective and reasonable executive incentive policies. Zhang Ran et al. (2018) found that executive compensation incentives can improve company performance. Luo Yuqun (2020) also believes that after implementing executive incentive policies, they have a positive effect on company performance and finds significant threshold effects of executive compensation incentives on company performance. Li Shufeng et al. (2020) conducted research indicating that executive incentives do indeed affect company performance, and compensation incentives have a substantial impact on operational performance, but the effect of equity incentives is not significant. To solve the principal-agent problem, companies began designing executive incentive policies to minimize agency costs and improve operational performance. Excessively high incentive levels can increase agency costs, which is undesirable for company owners. Additionally, moral risks for executives are potential issues under high incentive levels. On the other hand, low incentive levels do not have the desired effect. Therefore, a scientifically reasonable design of compensation incentives can greatly stimulate the enthusiasm of senior executives, leading to increased effort within their scope of work and improved company performance. It can also significantly enhance the company's innovative capabilities and commercial innovation, ultimately achieving the goal of improving company performance. Attracting senior executives with appropriate high salaries and motivating them to work hard for the development of the company can improve company performance while meeting the needs of management without incurring excessive agency costs for the company owners. Therefore, this study proposes the hypothesis:

H1: There is a significant positive correlation between executive compensation incentives and company performance.

### 2. The Impact of Executive Stock Incentives on Firm Performance

The development of a company relies on the participation of management personnel, and executives are the cornerstone of the survival and growth of a company. However, compensation incentives alone are not sufficient. Companies must have other means to align the long-term interests of executives with those of the company. Therefore, to motivate executives in the long run, stock incentives have emerged. Research by Mo Xiuting et al. (2018) found that stock incentives do not have a significant impact on firm performance in the short term but have a certain lag effect. The longer stock incentives are implemented, the more they can improve firm performance, showing significant effects. Studies by Shi Yufeng et al. (2019) found that when combined with firm performance, stock incentives can moderate research and development (R&D) investment; furthermore, reasonable stock incentive intensity can enhance a company's innovation capabilities and strengthen R&D. Zhu Jinye (2020) also reached similar conclusions. The results of their research showed that stock incentives have a positive impact on firm performance. However, in terms of incentive effectiveness, mature companies in established industries perform better than those in emerging industries in terms of the implementation methods of stock incentives and their impact on financial performance. Li Shaoting (2020) came to the same conclusion. Granting stock options to executives allows them to develop a sense of ownership, aligning the goals of company executives and owners, thereby improving firm performance. Meanwhile, executives will reflect their management achievements in stock prices, providing more information to investors and attracting funds for the long-term development of the company. Compared to compensation incentives, stock incentives provide longer-term motivation for executives and reduce short-sighted behavior. Therefore, this study proposes the hypothesis:

H2: There is a significant positive correlation between executive stock incentives and firm performance.

### 3. The Impact of Executive Incentives on Firm Performance under Different Property Rights

Different property rights imply differences in company characteristics, and the nature of the company affects its main business strategies and directions. Zhang Kuan et al. (2017) explored the role of executive incentive policies in the performance of state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises and concluded that after implementing executive incentive policies, non-state-owned enterprises achieved significant improvements in performance. On the contrary, state-owned enterprises experienced a decline in operational performance after implementing executive incentive policies. Executives in state-owned enterprises may also serve as government officials, prioritizing contributions to the country on the political level over monetary rewards. Therefore, in theory, executive incentive policies do not have a significant effect on state-owned enterprises. Conversely, non-state-owned enterprises require greater motivation for executives to serve the company in order to consolidate their position and sustain development in competitive environments. Thus, implementing executive incentive policies can align the interests of executives with those of the company, allowing executives to contribute their expertise and alleviate principal-agent problems, thereby improving firm performance. In terms of stock ownership, state-owned enterprises generally have lower or no stock holdings because their controlling shareholders are government entities. Therefore, the effectiveness of stock incentives is also weaker in state-owned enterprises compared to non-state-owned enterprises. After executives in non-state-owned enterprises obtain stock options, they strive to maximize their own interests by actively managing the company, leading to an improvement in firm performance. Therefore, this study proposes the hypotheses:

H3: The positive impact of executive compensation incentives on firm performance is more significant in state-owned enterprises compared to non-state-owned enterprises.

H4: The positive impact of executive stock incentives on firm performance is more significant in state-owned enterprises compared to non-state-owned enterprises.

## Research Design

### 1. Sample Selection and Data Source

Data from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2021 were extracted from the Guotai An database as the research sample. The following data were excluded: (1) ST and \*ST company stock samples; (2) listed companies in the insurance and financial industries; (3) data with abnormal or missing values in financial statements. After screening, 22,444 valid data samples were available. The preliminary summary and processing of the data were conducted using Excel spreadsheets, and regression analysis was performed on the valid data samples using Stata.

### 2. Variable Definitions and Model Construction

#### (1) Dependent Variable

In different studies, various indicators have been selected, and their impact on results differs. Most studies have used financial indicators such as return on equity and return on assets to replace firm performance for research purposes. To measure firm performance more accurately from a market perspective, this study uses the Tobin Q ratio as an indicator of firm performance.

#### (2) Independent Variables

Compensation incentives are the most common way to motivate executives in the short term and are often reflected in salary and bonuses. In this study, the total compensation of the top three executives in the company is measured as a monetary incentive after applying a natural logarithm transformation.

Stock incentives are a common long-term incentive for executives, enabling them to operate the company from the perspective of the company's owners. In this study, the percentage of stock holdings by executives is used to measure stock incentives.

#### (3) Control Variables

In addition to the main variables of the two incentives mentioned above, firm performance is influenced by other factors. To ensure the rigor of the research, this study selects variables such as firm size, ownership concentration, debt-paying ability, and operating capability as control variables, while considering year and industry effects.

|Property|Name|Symbol|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Dependent variable|Firm Performance|ROA|Ratio of market value to asset reset cost|
|Independent variable|Compensation Incentives|Econ 1|Natural logarithm of the total compensation of the top three executives in the company|
|Independent variable|Stock Incentives|Econ 2|Percentage of stock holdings by executives|
|Control variable|Firm Size|Size|Natural logarithm of total assets of the company|

|Control variable|Debt-paying Ability|Debt|Asset-liability ratio|
|Control variable|Operating Capability|Y1|Total asset turnover rate|
|Control variable|Year Effect|Year|Dummy variable|
|Control variable|Industry Effect|Industry|Dummy variable|

## Model Construction

Based on the research hypotheses proposed in the previous theoretical analysis, we construct two models to examine the impact of executive compensation incentives on firm performance (Hypothesis 1) and the impact of executive stock incentives on firm performance (Hypothesis 2), respectively. The specific models are as follows:

Model 1:
$$ROA = β_0 + β_1Econ1 + β_2Size + β_3Top1 + β_4Debt + β_5Y1 + β_6Year + β_7Industry + ε$$

Model 2:
$$ROA = β_0 + β_1Econ2 + β_2Size + β_3Top1 + β_4Debt + β_5Y1 + β_6Year + β_7Industry + ε$$

In the above two models, ROA represents firm performance, Econ1 represents executive compensation incentives, and Econ2 represents executive stock incentives. Size, Top1, Debt, Y1, Year, and Industry are control variables of the model, and ε represents the error term.

##  Empirical Results and Analysis

### 1. Descriptive Statistical Analysis

Before conducting empirical tests, we first describe the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values of each variable. Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the main variables.

Regarding firm performance, we can see from the table that its maximum and minimum values are 25.762% and -38.694%, respectively, indicating a significant gap in performance levels among Chinese companies. The average value is only 4.216%, indicating that there is still room for improvement. Regarding executive compensation incentives, we can see that the maximum value is 16.729 and the minimum value is 12.651, indicating that monetary incentives are still the main way of motivating executives. However, the incentive gap varies significantly, suggesting that the incentive plans designed by companies are not equally adaptable within the company. The average value of stock incentives is 8.52%, indicating that stock incentives have not yet been widely implemented. It is worth mentioning that some samples have a minimum value of almost 0, which is likely to be state-owned enterprises that do not implement stock incentives and where executives cannot hold shares. However, some companies attach great importance to stock incentives as an incentive method, and even show a trend of executive-led stock holding.

### 2. Correlation Analysis

After descriptive statistics of each variable, correlation analysis was conducted to measure the degree of correlation between variables. Table 3 shows that there is a correlation between each variable and enterprise performance. Monetary incentives and equity incentives are positively correlated with enterprise performance. On the contrary, control variables such as enterprise scale and equity concentration are negatively correlated, which requires further research after controlling for other uncertain factors. When the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is less than 0.8, there is less multicollinearity between variables. Looking at the data, the maximum value is the correlation coefficient between enterprise scale and asset-liability ratio, which is 0.247 < 0.8, indicating that the selection of variables is reasonable and regression analysis can be performed.

### 3. Multiple Regression Analysis

(1) The Impact of Executive Incentives on Enterprise Performance Table 4 shows the empirical regression results of the impact of executive incentives on enterprise performance when Tobin Q value is used as the dependent variable. The adjusted R2 of the model are 0.297 and 0.291 respectively, indicating that the proportion of enterprise performance explained through regression analysis is 29.7% and 29.1%. According to the analysis results, the compensation incentive Econ1 shows a significant level of 1%, and its coefficient of 0.016 is positive. This data shows that compensation incentive is positively correlated with enterprise performance, in other words, executive compensation incentive can promote enterprise performance, and hypothesis 1 is confirmed. Similarly, equity incentive Econ2 also shows a significant level of 1%, and its coefficient of 0.055 is positive. This data shows that equity incentive is positively correlated with enterprise performance, in other words, executive equity incentive can promote enterprise performance, and hypothesis 2 is confirmed.

(2) The Impact of Executive Incentives on Enterprise Performance under Different Property Rights According to the results, the goodness of fit of both Model (1) and Model (2) is above 20%, indicating that the constructed models have strong explanatory power. The empirical results show that the coefficients of compensation incentives for state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises are positive and significant at levels of 1%  in Model (1), indicating that the performance of both types of enterprises can be improved by compensation incentives. Looking closer at their coefficients, the coefficient of compensation incentive Econ1 for state-owned enterprises is 0.018, which is bigger than the coefficient of Econ2 for non-state-owned enterprises of 0.015, indicating that the improvement in enterprise performance through compensation incentives for state-owned enterprises is greater and more significant than that for non-state-owned enterprises, and hypothesis 3 is confirmed. The empirical results show that the coefficients of equity incentives for state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises in Model (2) are also positive and significant at levels of 1%, indicating that the performance of both types of enterprises can be improved by equity incentives. The coefficient of equity incentive Econ2 for state-owned enterprises is 0.067, which is bigger than the coefficient of Econ2 for non-state-owned enterprises of 0.047, proving that the improvement in enterprise performance through equity incentives for state-owned enterprises is greater and more significant than that for non-state-owned enterprises, and hypothesis 4 is confirmed.

### 4. Robustness Test

To verify the reliability of the empirical regression results mentioned above, this section replaces the dependent variable with the financial indicator of return on assets (ROA) for further investigation. ROA is a measure of operational performance based on accounting period profits, which represents the ratio of net profit to total assets over a certain accounting period. The purpose of this test is to obtain more accurate conclusions from the data. Due to space limitations, the results are not shown.

##  Research Conclusion and Implications

This study selects A-share listed companies in China from 2015 to 2021 as the research sample and conducts empirical analysis, resulting in the following conclusions. Firstly, based on descriptive analysis, it is found that the main form of executive incentives is still compensation incentives, and the differences in incentive levels among different companies are not significant. However, the implementation level of equity incentives varies, with some executives holding excessive shares, indicating their active participation in incentives. This is particularly evident in non-state-owned enterprises, where executives strive to maximize their own interests by expanding their shareholdings. On the other hand, some executives in state-owned enterprises have a 0% shareholding due to political factors, which prevent them from holding company shares. Secondly, through regression analysis, it is determined that both compensation incentives and equity incentives are significantly positively correlated with firm performance, regardless of whether the company is state-owned or non-state-owned. Compensation incentives can greatly enhance the motivation of executives and encourage them to make greater efforts to improve firm performance. Equity incentives align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, serving as a long-term incentive mechanism that reduces executives' short-sighted behavior and thus enhances firm performance. However, the effects of both incentive mechanisms are weaker in non-state-owned enterprises compared to state-owned enterprises. Executives, as important talent reserves for companies' competitiveness, need to maintain their motivation for work and reduce agency costs for the stable development of companies. Therefore, it is necessary for companies to formulate and implement a complete and reasonable set of executive incentive policies.
