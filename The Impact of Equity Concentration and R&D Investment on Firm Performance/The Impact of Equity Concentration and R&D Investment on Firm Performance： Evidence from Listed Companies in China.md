## Abstract:

This article examines the association between equity concentration, R&D investment, and performance of ChiNext-listed startups during the period of 2017 to 2021. The study also investigates the potential mediating effect of R&D investment. The results indicate that equity concentration negatively influences both enterprise performance and R&D investment, while increasing R&D investment can enhance enterprise performance. Furthermore, R&D investment mediates the relationship between equity concentration and enterprise performance, underscoring the importance of equity structure governance in listed companies.

## Keywords:

Equity concentration; R&D investment; Enterprise performance; ChiNext

### Ⅰ. Introduction

In China today, startups listed on the ChiNext board have gained increasing attention in the capital market due to their promising development prospects. However, major shareholders often hold high levels of control and decision-making power in the equity structures of these companies, which can significantly impact their performance. Imbalances in the equity structures of ChiNext companies can lead to operational risks and difficulties, and the prevalence of "one dominant shareholder" should be taken seriously. In 2021, China's investment in innovation reached a record high, with R&D expenditure approaching RMB 3 trillion. The ratio of R&D expenditure to GDP also increased to 2.44%, up 0.03 percentage points from the previous year. As important subjects for implementing national policies, ChiNext companies adhere to the concept that "innovation is the first driving force." Given the importance placed on innovation by the country, many scholars have shifted their research focus to ChiNext companies. Both the capital market and scholars recognize the significance of enterprises' long-term development abilities. While previous research has focused on the R&D performance brought by investments, there has been limited examination of how R&D investment affects enterprise performance. Similarly, while numerous studies have investigated the mechanism by which equity concentration affects the performance of listed companies, few have examined all three factors (equity concentration, R&D investment, and enterprise performance) within a systematic framework for ChiNext companies. Therefore, this paper selects data from ChiNext companies between 2017 and 2021, tests panel data constructed through empirical analysis, explores the mechanism by which equity concentration of ChiNext companies affects enterprise performance, and specifically focuses on the mediating effect of R&D investment between the two. The paper aims to contribute to our understanding of the causal relationship between these factors and inform national policies and long-term development strategies for enterprises.

### Ⅱ.Theoretical Analysis and Research Hypotheses

#### 1. Concentration of Ownership and Firm Performance

There is no clear consensus in the academic community regarding the relationship between the concentration of ownership and firm performance. Long and Wang (2020) found that the relationship between the two is not a simple linear one. Only when the concentration of ownership is moderate does it have a positive impact on firm financial performance, showing an inverted U-shaped relationship. Wang (2021) concluded, based on a study of SMEs listed on the SME board, that there is a positive correlation between the concentration of ownership and firm performance. Hu and Wu (2020) conducted a detailed study on the relationship between the ownership attributes of major shareholders and firm performance, and found that the relationship between firm performance and the proportion of state-owned shares follows an inverted U-shaped pattern, while the proportion of legal person shares has a significant positive correlation. The proportion of the largest shareholder follows an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm performance. Some scholars argue that there is no significant relationship between the concentration of ownership and firm performance.

For companies listed on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM), it is common for a major shareholder to dominate the company, and conflicts of interest between minority shareholders and the major shareholder are more pronounced due to the presence of expropriation-type governance practices by the major shareholder. The performance of the company is also a matter of great concern to shareholders, as it reflects the competitiveness of the company in the capital market. However, in general, shareholders tend to focus on their own interests. There is a close relationship between the concentration of ownership and firm performance. In a company, shareholders play a balancing role against each other, but this balance is significantly weaker in GEM companies. Based on the above analysis, we propose Hypothesis 1:

H1: Holding other conditions constant, the concentration of ownership inhibits firm performance in GEM companies.

#### 2. Concentration of Ownership and Research and Development (R&D) Investment

A key indicator of ownership distribution in research is the concentration of ownership. Ren (2020) found that manufacturing companies with a high concentration of ownership have a greater willingness to increase R&D investment, indicating a positive correlation between the concentration of ownership and R&D investment. However, Miao (2017) holds the opposite view, suggesting that companies with a high concentration of ownership are less inclined to allocate funds to R&D due to the interests of major shareholders, and as the concentration of ownership increases, R&D investment decreases significantly. Zhang and Xu (2014) found that the relationship between the two is not linear, with the concentration of ownership being inversely U-shaped related to current and next period R&D investment.

For a company to achieve sustainable development, it needs to continuously improve its innovation capabilities, and the government strongly supports innovation in enterprises. Government subsidies and industry support demonstrate the importance of increasing R&D investment. The effectiveness of R&D investment is often reflected in firm performance, as successful R&D activities can give a company a competitive advantage in the market and lead to high performance results. However, sometimes the impact of R&D investment on firm performance may not be evident in the current period, as there may be a significant lag effect. Based on the analysis above, we propose Hypothesis 2:

H2: Holding other conditions constant, R&D investment promotes firm performance improvement in GEM companies.

#### 3. Research and Development (R&D) Investment and Firm Performance

Analysis of existing literature on the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance in GEM companies has not yielded a definitive conclusion. Li and Geng (2021) studied all A-share listed companies and found a positive correlation between the two, suggesting that companies with higher R&D investment tend to have better performance. Lu (2017) also agreed with this view and further research showed that the impact of R&D investment on firm performance has a lag effect. However, Zhang (2015) found that R&D investment has a negative effect on the current financial performance. Liu (2017) analyzed industrial enterprises and found a non-linear relationship between the two, following an inverted U-shaped pattern.

From the literature review on the relationship between the three variables, it is evident that the decision-making process for R&D investment in GEM companies is greatly influenced by the concentration of ownership, especially when the major shareholder holds a dominant position in decision-making. This will also affect the ultimate operational performance of the company. For companies with high R&D investment, the likelihood of generating R&D output and its impact on firm performance is greater. From the perspective of shareholders, major shareholders are involved in important decision-making processes of the company, including decisions related to R&D investment. From a causal logic perspective, the concentration of ownership first affects the decision-making process for R&D investment, and whether the market recognizes the value of R&D outcomes will also significantly influence firm performance. Based on the above analysis, we propose Hypothesis 3:

H3: Holding other conditions constant, R&D investment mediates the relationship between the concentration of ownership and firm performance in GEM companies.

### III. Research Design

#### 1. Sample Selection and Data Sources

Given the growing emphasis on R&D investment in recent years, this study focused on a preliminary sample of companies listed on the ChiNext board between 2017 and 2021. The analysis excluded the following categories: financial industry companies, ST and \*ST listed companies, and companies with missing data. To mitigate the potential influence of extreme values on empirical results, the variables were Winsorized at the 1% and 99% levels using Stata16. After removing 16 observations, a total of 4081 valid samples were retained for analysis. All the data utilized in this study were obtained from the Guotai Junan Securities database and analyzed using Stata16 software for data processing.

#### 2. Model Construction and Variable Definitions

The explanatory variable in this study is enterprise performance, measured by TobinQ value, which can reflect the market value of the company. For ChiNext companies, the results of R&D investment will be reflected in the market. The explanatory variable is equity concentration (Top10), measured by the proportion of the top ten shareholders' holdings in the company. The mediator variable is R&D investment (RD), calculated as the ratio of the company's R&D expenditure to total operating income. Based on existing research, the following control variables were selected: enterprise size (Size), asset-liability ratio (Lev), cash flow (Cashflow), property + nature (SOE), return on total assets (ROA), enterprise growth (Growth), as well as virtual variables for year and industry (Indnme).

The following models were constructed to conduct hypothesis testing:

$TobinQ = α_1 + α_1 Top10 + α_2 Size + α_3 Lev + α_4 Growth + α_5 Cashflow + α_6 SOE + α_7 ROA + α_8 ∑ Indnme + α_9 ∑ year + ε (1)$
$TobinQ = β_1 + β_1 RD + β_2 Size + β_3 Lev + β_4 Growth + β_5 Cashflow + β_6 SOE + β_7 ROA + β_8 ∑ Indnme + β_9 ∑ year + ε (2)$
$TobinQ = γ_1 + γ_1 Toop10 + γ_2 RD + γ_3 Size + γ_4 Lev + γ_5 Growth + γ_6 Cashflow + γ_7 SOE + γ_8 ROA + γ_9 ∑ Indnme + γ_10 ∑ year + ε (3)$

### Ⅳ. Empirical Analysis

#### 1. Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 shows that from 2017 to 2021, the minimum value of TobinQ was 0.958, the maximum value was 10.64, and the mean was 2.252, indicating that ChiNext companies have developed well and good performance is well received in the capital market. In terms of the TOP10 indicator, the average holding proportion of the top ten shareholders in ChiNext companies is 58.31%, indicating that equity is concentrated in the hands of controlling shareholders. In ChiNext companies, R&D expenditure can amount to as much as 83.23% of total operating income, indicating a high level of importance placed on R&D. However, the minimum value is only 0.04%, suggesting that some companies may face the risk of business failure due to inadequate R&D.

#### 2. Correlation Analysis

The findings of the Pearson correlation analysis are presented in Table 2. The results reveal significant negative correlations between equity concentration and market performance (p < .01), confirming hypothesis 1, and between equity concentration and R&D investment (p < .01), supporting hypothesis 2. Additionally, the absolute values of the correlation coefficients between the variables do not exceed 0.800, indicating that multicollinearity is not a major concern in the model.

#### 3. Multiple Regression Analysis

The results of the multiple regression analysis are presented in Table 3. The coefficient of equity concentration is significantly negative, indicating that a higher equity concentration in ChiNext companies has a negative impact on their performance by weakening the efficiency of resource allocation. Hypothesis 1 is confirmed. Moreover, the relationship between equity concentration and R&D investment is found to be significantly negatively correlated at the 1% level, with a regression coefficient of -0.0345. This means that a higher equity concentration in ChiNext companies results in a suppression of R&D investment, as the companies' actual controllers primarily focus on risk control and are less willing to wait for long-term enterprise performance. Hypothesis 2 is also verified.

#### 4. Robustness Test

The robustness test used in this study introduced a lagged variable as an endogenous variable, using a one-period lag. From Table 4, we can see that the above hypotheses still hold. The negative effect of the lagged equity concentration on enterprise performance has weakened, but the negative effect of the lagged equity concentration on R&D investment has not weakened. This indicates that the variables chosen in this study are appropriate.

### V. Research Conclusions and Recommendations

This article focuses on the relationship between equity concentration, research and development (R&D) investment, and corporate performance in the context of the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) companies. Specifically, it discusses the relationship between equity concentration and market performance, as well as the mediating role of R&D investment. The research confirms the hypotheses proposed in this article.

Firstly, R&D investment is crucial for GEM companies, as it is the core competitiveness for their long-term development in the market. Furthermore, the promotion effect of R&D investment on corporate performance is not immediately visible and has a certain lag. GEM companies should understand that output cannot be achieved overnight and should be prepared for long-term efforts.

For GEM companies, a dominant shareholder is not desirable. High equity concentration can harm the interests of minority shareholders and affect the potential for future company development. R&D investment plays a mediating role in the relationship between equity concentration and corporate performance.

GEM companies should actively engage in R&D activities and convert the results into benefits. They should also effectively grasp the lag effect mechanism of R&D outcomes on company performance through proactive and efficient corporate governance to achieve the rational use of funds. Adjusting the corporate equity structure and improving the phenomenon of controlling shareholders having complete decision-making power can help. This can be achieved by diversifying equity, increasing R&D investment funds, and striving to improve corporate governance. The board of directors can also enhance the responsibility mechanism of the company by attracting certain investors to form a balanced situation of equity, raising awareness among existing shareholders, and improving corporate governance capabilities.
