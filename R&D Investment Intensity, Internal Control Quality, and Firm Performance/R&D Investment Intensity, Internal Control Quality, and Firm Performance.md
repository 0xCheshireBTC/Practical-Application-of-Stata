## Abstract:

Based on a sample of 104 listed pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in China's A-share market from 2012 to 2020 and combining relevant domestic and foreign literature, this study uses multiple linear regression to conduct empirical research. The results show that R&D investment has a significant promoting effect on firm performance for pharmaceutical manufacturing companies. Internal control quality significantly positively affects financial performance. The effective internal control system has a positive regulatory effect on the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance, as well as promoting "peer effect" in R&D investment for listed pharmaceutical manufacturing companies.

## Keywords:

Internal control; R&D investment; Firm performance; Pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.

## Introduction

The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly states that China's economy has shifted from high-speed growth to high-quality development and emphasizes the need to accelerate the construction of an innovative country and a world-leading science and technology power. In April 2010, five ministries and commissions jointly issued the "Guidelines for Supporting Internal Control Regulations", marking the basic completion of the enterprise internal control regulatory system, which is centered on risk prevention and fraud control, with control standards and evaluation criteria as the main body, structured with clear levels, orderly connections, scientific methods, and complete systems. The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry is characterized by high investment, high risk, and high returns. Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturing companies need to change their inherent development concepts, have a long-term perspective, and focus on improving product technological content and enhancing independent innovation capabilities. At the same time, in order to effectively prevent the risks that may arise from R&D investment, it is necessary to implement an effective internal control system for the overall process of R&D activities. Therefore, this article focuses on the technology-intensive pharmaceutical manufacturing industry and explores the relationship between R&D investment, internal control, and firm performance.

## 1 Literature Review and Research Hypotheses

### 1.1 R&D Investment and Firm Performance

Some scholars believe that R&D investment has a strengthening effect on a firm's financial performance. Wake[1] conducted a study using the Cobb-Douglas function and found that increasing R&D investment directly enhances the company's production efficiency. Chaipom[2], using non-financial companies from 1990 to 2013 as a sample, empirically studied the relationship between R&D intensity and company value, and the results showed a positive correlation between the two. Cao Yang and Yi Qiqi[3] selected listed companies in China's biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry from 2012 to 2015 as research samples and found a significant positive correlation between R&D investment and firm performance.

Other studies have shown that increasing R&D intensity significantly improves firm performance, but its impact has a certain lag. OlaL et al.[4] pointed out that R&D intensity is positively correlated with a company's benefits, but the impact has a lag. Wang Juncai and Wang Shufang[5] conducted a study using 54 top electronic information companies as samples, and the results showed an insignificant positive correlation between R&D investment and firm performance, and the impact also has a lag.

Some scholars believe that research and development (R&D) investment has a significant inhibitory effect on improving corporate performance. Huang Yu and Han Chao[6]'s study, using new energy industry companies as samples, found that R&D investment has a negative impact on firm performance. Zhang Jian and Zhang Linghong[7]'s research results show that R&D investment does not have a positive impact on financial performance.

Based on the resource-based theory, the more solid the resource base a company possesses, the more it will gradually transform into a more obvious competitive advantage during project activities, resulting in better financial performance. R&D resources are a representative heterogeneous resource containing a large amount of technical knowledge. Companies can drive innovation and continuously advance product development and upgrades, maximizing the use of their resource advantages. Therefore, pharmaceutical manufacturing companies must continuously optimize their process flow, improve R&D efficiency, and reduce production costs to enhance financial performance. Based on the above, the following hypothesis is proposed: 
$H_1$: R&D investment has a positive promoting effect on firm performance, and this effect has lag.

### 1.2 Internal control quality and firm performance 
Lin Zhonggao[8] et al. believe that for listed companies in China, the effectiveness of internal control has a significant positive impact on firm performance. Dale Stoel et al.[9], using the IT industry as a sample, found that if the implementation of a company's internal control system is unsatisfactory compared to other companies with relatively good internal control quality, it will have a negative impact on firm performance. Jiang Qimei and Chu Yang[10]'s empirical research results show that the higher the effectiveness of internal control in pharmaceutical companies, the more it promotes firm performance improvement.

According to the internal control theory, internal control affects firm performance in terms of internal control objectives and the five elements of internal control. A sound internal control system can to some extent alleviate conflicts arising from different stakeholders' different positions, remedy information asymmetry problems, and improve corporate governance structures, thereby ensuring the achievement of financial performance goals. In summary, a high-quality internal control system can send positive signals to the market and investors, giving them greater confidence in the company. Based on this, the following hypothesis is proposed: 
$H_2$: Internal control quality has a positive promoting effect on firm performance.

### 1.3 R&D investment, internal control quality, and firm performance 
Gong Yifei and Xia Yanchun[11] believe that higher internal control quality and an improved supervision and incentive mechanism can enhance the execution effectiveness of R&D projects, thereby playing a positive regulatory role in the impact of R&D investment on firm performance. Sun Ziyuan et al. (2019) believe that in the current and lag periods, high-quality internal control has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance. When optimized internal control combines with R&D innovation, the ability to create enterprise value will be significantly enhanced.

R&D activities have special characteristics, and the entire process involves a lot of uncertainty and risk. An effective internal control system can impede the occurrence of other deviations in R&D activities through mandatory constraints and solidify the activities throughout the information system, ensuring smooth project progress and enhancing performance. The implementation of a high-quality internal control system can maximize the avoidance of improper management behaviors or decisions, serving as a risk prevention and correction mechanism. To enhance their R&D investment, companies must strictly implement the requirements of the internal control system, measure the degree of internal control implementation with quantitative indicators, and improve governance effectiveness by perfecting internal control elements. A sound internal control system can also promote the improvement of decision quality, optimize operational capabilities, and benefit firm performance in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. Based on the above analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed: 
$H_3$: Internal control quality has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance.
## 2. Sample Selection and Research Design

### 2.1 Data Source and Sample Selection

In this study, data from 2012 to 2020 of 104 listed pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in the A-share market are selected as the research sample. The internal control index is sourced from DiBo Limited's "DiBo - China Listed Company Internal Control Index" and other data such as R&D investment are obtained from the CSMAR database. After excluding ST and \*ST companies and samples with missing data, a total of 936 valid data points are analyzed, and continuous variables are truncated at the 1% and 99% levels.

### 2.2 Variable Selection and Definition

#### 2.2.1 Dependent Variable

The study uses the Return on Assets (ROA) to measure the financial performance of the company, which objectively reflects its ability to generate profits from existing assets. The ROA indicator can effectively assess whether a company's management level meets the standard.

#### 2.2.2 Independent Variables

Currently, there are two main indicators for measuring research and development (R&D) innovation: the absolute amount of R&D investment and the relative amount of R&D investment. Due to differences in company size, it is not feasible to compare the absolute amounts between companies of different sizes. Therefore, this study chooses R&D intensity, i.e., the ratio of R&D investment to total assets, as the measure of R&D innovation input.

#### 2.2.3 Moderating Variable

This study mainly examines the impact of internal control quality on firm performance, using the DIB Internal Control Index to measure the level of internal control. This index comprehensively considers the five elements of internal control structure and has comprehensiveness and integrity. The natural logarithm of this index is used to measure the quality of internal control.

#### 2.2.4 Control Variables

Based on existing research, this study selects four variables as control variables: company size (SIZE), leverage (LEV), growth (GROW), and operating cash flow (OCF). The natural logarithm of total assets is used to measure company size, which demonstrates the difference in scale among sample companies. Studies have shown that leverage (LEV) has a negative impact on firm value (ROA), reflecting the company's long-term debt-paying ability. When the leverage is high, the pressure to repay principal and interest is greater, which may affect its financing capacity and have a negative impact on firm performance. The growth of a company is measured by the growth rate of total assets, and it is generally associated with higher firm performance if the growth rate is relatively high. It is known from previous research that internal cash flow can affect R&D intensity. When internal cash flow is abundant, companies usually consider increasing R&D investment in innovation activities. Therefore, the internal cash flow (OCF) is selected as a control variable. Additionally, to eliminate the time effect, the year (YEAR) is selected as a dummy control variable. The variable definitions are detailed in Table 1.

|Variable Type|Variable Name|Variable Symbol|Variable Definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|Dependent Variable|Enterprise Performance|ROA|The ratio of after-tax net profit to average net assets|
|Independent Variable|R&D Investment Intensity|R&D|The ratio of R&D investment to total assets|
|Moderating Variable|Internal Control Quality|ICQ|Natural logarithm of the Debond Internal Control Index|
|Control Variables|Firm Size|SIZE|Natural logarithm of year-end total assets|
||Leverage|LEV|Total liabilities divided by total assets|
||Company Growth|GROW|(Current year's operating income - previous year's operating income) divided by current year's operating income|
||Operating Cash Flow|OCF|Net cash flows from operating activities divided by total assets|
||Year|YEAR|1 if it is in that year, 0 otherwise|


## 2.3 Model Specification

Based on the theoretical analysis, hypotheses, and variable definitions mentioned above, this study constructs a research framework of "R&D Investment - Internal Control - Firm Performance". The firm performance is the dependent variable, and the correlation between R&D investment and firm performance, as well as the quality of internal control and firm performance, are empirically studied. To test hypothesis H1, H2, and H3, the following models are established:

Model 1: Relationship between R&D Investment and Firm Performance: 

$$ROA_{(i,t)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 R\&D_{(i,t)} + \beta_2 SIZE_{(i,t)} + \beta_3 LEV_{(i,t)} + \beta_4 GROW_{(i,t)} + \beta_5 OCF_{(i,t)} + \beta_6 YEAR_{(i,t-1)} + \varepsilon_{(i,t)} \tag{1}$$

Model 2: Relationship between Internal Control Quality and Firm Performance: 

$$\text{ROA}_{(i,t)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ICQ_{(i,t)} + \beta_2 SIZE_{(i,t)} + \beta_3 LEV_{(i,t)} + \beta_4 GROW_{(i,t)} + \beta_5 OCF_{(i,t)} + \beta_6 YEAR_{(i,t-1)} + \varepsilon_{(i,t)} \tag{2}$$

Model 3: Influence of Internal Control Quality on the Relationship between R&D Investment and Firm Performance: 

$$\text{ROA}_{(i,t)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 R\&D_{(i,t)} + \beta_2 ICQ_{(i,t)} + \beta_3 R\&D_{(i,t)} ICQ_{(i,t)} + \beta_4 SIZE_{(i,t)} + \beta_5 LEV_{(i,t)} + \beta_6 GROW_{(i,t-1)} + \beta_7 OCF_{(i,t)}+ \beta_8 YEAR_{(i,t)} + \varepsilon_{(i,t)} \tag{3}$$

## 3 Empirical Analysis

### 3.1 Descriptive Statistical Analysis

As shown in Table 2, the mean value of return on assets (ROA) for pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in China is 0.070, with a minimum value of -0.382 and a maximum value of 0.257. These values indicate that there is a large gap in financial performance among these companies and their development speed is not balanced. The average value of R&D investment is 0.023, with a maximum value of 0.135 and a minimum value of 0.002. It is widely recognized in academia that R&D investment levels higher than 2% are considered normal, and to have strong competitiveness in the industry, R&D intensity should be greater than 5%. The level of R&D innovation investment in China's pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises needs to be strengthened, and there are significant differences in the importance attached to R&D innovation investment by sample companies. The mean value of internal control quality (ICQ) is 6.481, with the maximum and minimum values being 6.831 and 5.759, respectively, indicating that there is a significant gap in the quality of internal control among the researched companies, leaving much room for improvement.

| OCF      | 936 | .068323  | .0582889  | -.0961064 | .2628965 |
### 3.2 Correlation Analysis

As shown in Table 3, the correlation coefficient between ROA and R&D investment is 0.197, which is significantly positively correlated at the 1% level. This indicates that strengthening R&D investment can improve a company's financial performance among the sample companies. The correlation coefficient between enterprise performance and internal control quality (ICQ) is 0.426, showing a significant positive correlation between the two. This reflects that the internal control quality of sample companies is good, and if well-designed internal control systems can be effectively implemented, it will greatly promote the improvement of enterprise performance. The correlation coefficient between leverage (LEV) and financial performance is -0.425, indicating a negative correlation relationship. This suggests that companies with relatively conservative capital structures also have relatively low leverage and better financial performance. The results of the correlation analysis of the above variables are in line with basic economic laws and consistent with theoretical analysis in this article.

To ensure the stability of subsequent regression analysis, this article conducted VIF multicollinearity tests. The maximum value of the VIF was 1.13, and the overall VIF values were less than 2. The test results met the standards of having a maximum value greater than 10 and an average value greater than 1, indicating that the subsequent regression analysis can exclude the interference of multicollinearity.

### 3.3 Regression Analysis

#### 3.3.1 Regression Analysis of R&D Investment and Enterprise Performance

This article used Stata18 to conduct multiple regression analysis on the sample data, the results of which are shown in Table 4. From the regression results of the current period R&D in Model (1), it can be seen that the current period R&D regression coefficient is 0.334, which is significantly positively correlated with enterprise performance at the 1% level. This indicates that increasing R&D investment intensity is conducive to the improvement of company performance among the sample companies. The regression results of lagged one period ($R\&D_{(t-1)}$) and lagged two periods ($R\&D_{(t-2)}$) show that R&D investment is significantly positively correlated with financial performance, and its value increases year by year. This increasing trend indicates that the impact of R&D investment has a lag effect due to its unique nature, and hypothesis H1 is established.

#### 3.3.2 Internal Control Quality and Enterprise Performance

From the results of Model (2) in Table 5, it can be seen that the Internal Control Quality Index (ICQ) is significantly positively correlated with the financial performance indicators of enterprises at the 1% level, with a coefficient of 0.148. This indicates that the establishment of a sound internal control environment in pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises in China can help improve their financial performance, which verifies Hypothesis $H_2$. The empirical results show that establishing and implementing internal controls can improve the quality of internal controls in enterprises, enable companies to use mandatory constraints to prevent deviation behaviors, ensure the continuous and effective implementation of R&D projects, and achieve the goal of improving enterprise performance. Enterprises should actively guard against risks, adopt precise and efficient internal control measures, combine them with their own risk tolerance and risk assessment results, and minimize risks.

#### 3.3.3 The Moderating Effect of Internal Control Quality on the Relationship between R&D Investment and Enterprise Performance

The regression results of Model (3) in Table 5 show that the regression coefficient of the interaction term (R&D × ICQ) is 3.011, which is significantly positively related to enterprise performance. This indicates that the internal control quality has a significant positive effect on the relationship between R&D investment and enterprise performance, that is, internal control quality can positively regulate the relationship between the two, verifying Hypothesis $H_3$. Enterprises need to strictly implement internal control systems to make them truly serve the production and operation of enterprises, rather than just being formalities. A scientific and reasonable internal control system can reduce risks in enterprise R&D activities, enable relevant personnel such as management and R&D personnel to concentrate their energy on the overall interests of the company, help management make more reasonable decisions, avoid excessive waste of resources, reduce R&D costs, and improve R&D efficiency.

### 3.4 Robustness Check

To enhance the reliability of the conclusions, this paper selects Tobin's Q value as a financial indicator to replace enterprise performance (Roa) as a robustness check variable. The regression results of the robustness check in Table 6 show that after the explanatory variable is replaced, the regression results are basically consistent with the research conclusions of this paper, indicating that the empirical results of this paper are relatively robust.

## 5 Conclusions and Implications

### 5.1 Research Conclusions

The research results of this paper show that for pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises, high-intensity and sustained R&D investment can lay a solid foundation for the long-term interests and internal capacity enhancement of enterprises. High-quality internal control can not only promote the growth of enterprise performance but also play a positive regulatory role in the relationship between R&D investment and enterprise performance during the implementation of R&D projects. After a long period of sustained R&D investment, R&D projects can eventually be transformed into the company's patent, technical and other resources, enhancing its core competitiveness and ultimately improving economic benefits.

### 5.2 Managerial Implications

Based on the above analysis, this paper draws the following implications:

1. Based on the specificity and lag of R&D investment, companies should maintain good patience and continuously invest funds and human resources in the early stage of R&D projects. Only when the R&D project completes the transformation from quantitative change to qualitative change can it enjoy the rich profits and value brought to the enterprise.
2. Adhere to the implementation of innovation-driven strategies, use R&D results to form a higher labor skill premium, and maximize the utilization of knowledge and technical resources owned by the enterprise to promote directional technological progress in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.
3. Establish an appropriate internal control system and improve risk prevention and management systems. Enterprises need to enhance their risk prevention awareness, strengthen their risk management system, and establish sound risk management mechanisms.
